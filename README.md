This was an experiment to webscrap an existing blog and improve it by using Hugo.

`scraper/` - directory of the scraping script
  - `npm install` to install all dependencies
  - `npm run start` to scrape the blog content and save to folder `content/posts/`

Run `hugo` in the root directory to build
