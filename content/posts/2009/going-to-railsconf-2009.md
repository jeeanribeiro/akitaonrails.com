<p>I will depart from Brazil at 10:55PM local time and should be arriving in Las Vegas tomorrow, Sunday, around 1:15PM. I will be staying at the <a href="https://stratospherehotel.com">Stratosphere Hotel</a>, a little bit far from the Hilton.</p>
<p>I will not attend any of the tutorials on the first day. Maybe I will try to be at the Hilton, maybe I will try to be at CabooseConf. First thing I will try to do on Sunday is getting my <a href="https://gizmodo.com/5061605/apple-confirms-failing-nvidia-graphics-cards-in-macbook-pros-offers-free-repairs-and-refunds">Macbook Pro fixed</a> :-) I will probably have to buy a new unit and I will spend the rest of the day restoring from my backup.</p>
<p>At the airport I should try to buy a pre-paid <span class="caps">SIM</span> card, so I can be reached more easily. But if anyone wants to get in touch with me, I think <a href="https://twitter.com/akitaonrails">Twitter</a> will be the easiest way. I will be checking my e-mail constantly also.</p>
<p>My schedule is available at <a href="https://railsconf.intridea.com/">Intridea</a> or you can directly subscribe to my <a href="https://en.oreilly.com/rails2009/public/schedule/my_ical/46ebf9ee2c82e80d8ca1217bc7f04651">iCal calendar</a>, so you may be able to reach me at the sessions, though it is uncertain that I will be actually following my own schedule :-) I have the tendency to hang out with people at random, so if I am not at the planned session, I am probably talking to people, making interviews, recording and so on.</p>
<p>My main goal with RailsConf is to talk to as many people as possible. The thing I like the most about this conference is the sheer ammount of insightful people and interesting talks.</p>
