<p>Last night I made available www.rubistas.com.br, a translation fork of the original <a href="https://rubyists.eu">Rubyists.eu</a>. I thought it’s a great website because of its simplicity on the approach to group together communities and make them easier to find for everyone.</p>
<p>But, I was careless. According to the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons License</a> I failed to add proper attribution to Rock &amp; Code and Rubyists.EU. So, Rock &amp; Code contacted me. We talked and I agreed to cease and desist both my fork at github and the website.</p>
<p>I was told that the way I wrote the original blog post in Portuguese (already removed) did upset some of the European collaborators. Specially the part that would translate as <em>“… it is nothing more than a Google Maps mashup.”</em> Again, the intention was never to be negative, quite contrary, it was to pinpoint the fact that it would not be difficult for people to collaborate.</p>
<p>So, rubistas.com.br will remain down. I have no plans for it for the time being.</p>
