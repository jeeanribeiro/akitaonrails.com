<p>One person that I didn’t have the opportunity to interview until this day was David Hansson himself. We talked briefly a few times in the past but this was our first longer conversation.</p>
<div id="playerhntxLstuECOP"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">
  jwplayer('playerhntxLstuECOP').setup({
    file: 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/videos-akitaonrails/Akitaonrails-RailsConf2010DavidHeinemeirHansson804.flv',
    title: 'Interview - David Heinemeir Hansson (Railsconf 2010)',
    width: '100%',
    aspectratio: '4:3'
  });
</script>
<p>I particularly enjoyed this interview because he was very easy going. We discussed about the Rails 3 project, what he is enjoying more about it. We also talked about old stuff, such as the story of when he visited Brazil in 2005 – if you didn’t know that, check it out!</p>
<p>Besides that we also talked a bit about “Rework” related subjects such as people management, entrepreneurship. And I couldn’t let go the opportunity to mention Ricardo Semler to him, of course :-)</p>
<p>So a nice conversation – of around 24 minutes – with David Hansson himself, is a good way to wrap up my material on RailsConf 2010. Excellent event, excellent people and I hope to be able to meet you all again next year!</p>
