<p>Brazil went official in the worldwide Ruby on Rails conference roadmap with 2008’s “Rails Summit Latin America”. This was the very first big conference around Rails in the continent and a very successful one, gathering more than 550 attendees each year. We had more than 20 speakers, 2 full days, 2 parallel sessions with real-time translations.</p>
<p>Now, it is 2010, and I have decided that Rails Summit is no more …</p>

<h3>RubyConf Latin America</h3>

<p>… because it’s being replaced for the first edition of <strong>RubyConf Latin America</strong>! We managed to partner with Ruby Central, and they authorized the usage of the name.</p>
<p>We are already confirmed for <strong>October, 26th and 27th</strong>, this time at <a href="https://www.convencoesfreicaneca.com.br/Conteudo.asp">Frei Caneca Convention Center</a>, in São Paulo, very near to the famous Paulista Ave. area.</p>
<p>After 2 years of experience we were able to optimize the costs even further, therefore the registration fee went down to <strong><span class="caps">BRL</span> 150</strong> (~ <span class="caps">USD</span> 78) with registration starting in <strong>August</strong>. We will maintain the same format with 2 full days of sessions, 2 parallel tracks, real time translation from English to Portuguese and Portuguese to English, coffee-break, the entire package. The quality will be the same.</p>
<p>Locaweb will keep on being the stewardship and main sponsor of the event. With 2 successful deliveries, I can’t think of a better partner. So it will be “RubyConf Latin America by locaweb, co-presented by Ruby Central”.</p>
