<p>After a long gap I finally managed to contribute a bit to <strong>RubyLearning.org</strong>. I’ve written a 2 part article about Internationalization (i18n) in Brazilian Portuguese a few days ago. I’ve adapted it into English and you can read it at <a href="https://rubylearning.com/blog/2012/07/24/minimal-i18n-with-rails-3-2/">Satish’s blog</a>.</p>
<p>I’m showing snippets of code from a demonstration app and you can see the code at <a href="https://github.com/akitaonrails/Rails-3-I18n-Demonstration">my Github repo</a> and you can also see the app up and <a href="https://rubylearning.com/blog/2012/07/24/minimal-i18n-with-rails-3-2/i18n-demo.herokuapp.com">running here</a>, thanks to Heroku’s free accounts.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>
