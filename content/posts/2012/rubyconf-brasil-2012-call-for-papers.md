<p>I’ve been a bit late in promoting RubyConf Brazil this year, I apologize for that. I’ve released the <a href="https://rubyconfbr-callforpapers.cm42.com.br/">Call for Papers</a> website a few days ago but I was only able to post about it today. If you want to come talk at our conference, please submit your talk as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Because of these delays, I’ve extended the Call for Papers until <strong>April 27th</strong>. If you don’t have a complete description of your talk proposal yet, you can submit right now and the website will email you back a unique link that will enable you to update it until the deadline.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rubyconf.com.br">RubyConf Brazil</a> is going to be the 5th consecutive big Ruby event in Brazil. To give you an example, the last few editions gathered more than 700 attendees each. We had great names such as David Black, Aaron Patterson, Konstantin Haase, and many other great names. The Brazilian and Latin American markets have been blooming, demand is rising and a new generation of developers and startups are growing very fast.</p>
<p>The conference will take place in São Paulo, at the <a href="https://maps.google.com.br/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;geocode=&amp;q=PP+Shop+Frei+Caneca+-+Rua+Frei+Caneca,+569+-+Consolação,+Sao+Paulo&amp;aq=1&amp;oq=Centro+de+Con&amp;sll=-23.600871,-46.741466&amp;sspn=0.013823,0.022724&amp;t=h&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=PP+Shop+Frei+Caneca+-&amp;hnear=R.+Frei+Caneca,+569+-+Consolação,+São+Paulo,+01307-001&amp;z=17&amp;vpsrc=0&amp;iwloc=A&amp;cid=3314016219789104233">Frei Caneca Conference Center</a> , on <strong>August 30th and 31st</strong>. If you’re coming from abroad and your company is sponsoring your travel expenses, it’s also automatically added as an sponsor for the event, appearing in our marketing material and website (to be released soon).</p>
<p>So, without further ado, go to the <a href="https://rubyconfbr-callforpapers.cm42.com.br/">Call for Papers</a> website and add your talk proposal.</p>
