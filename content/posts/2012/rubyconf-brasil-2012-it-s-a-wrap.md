<p>Rubyconf Brasil 2012 was a blast!</p>

<p>I personally still pinch myself every time when I think about it, when I decided to commit to this endeavour back in 2008 neither I nor anyone would ever think that we would be able to make more than 1 Ruby Conference in Brazil. But against all odds we have been able to pull it off. 5 years have passed and every year is an improvement over the previous one. Locaweb has been a fantastic partner, and I don't think any other company in Brazil would have the same level of commitment, delivering more than expected year after year.</p>
<p>This year we had an astounding <strong>750 attendees</strong> at Frei Caneca Convention Center and with the help of <a href="http://eventials.com/rubyconfbr2012">Eventials</a> we added at least 500 more watching in real time during the 2 days of the conference. We also had the most dense Rubyconf Brasil ever with a mind boggling <strong>31 talks</strong>, <strong>36 speakers</strong> out of which <strong>14</strong> came from outside of Brazil.</p>
<p>We, of the Rubyconf Brasil staff, hope that everyone found something you really liked and that everybody had a great time. And I personally wish that if you liked it, you keep helping the Ruby community to grow larger in Latin America.</p>
